<p>Use keyboard shortcuts to quickly shift calendar view.</p> 
<h3>Here are the shortcuts I find most useful.</h3>

<ul>
    <li>A = Switch to agenda view for a clean list of upcoming meetings.</li>
    <li>W = Get an overview of your week. This is the default view I prefer. </li>
    <li>M = See your month at a glance. Useful for spotting empty or overbooked days. </li>
    <li>Y = Look at the whole year. Helps me quickly see what day of the week a future event will fall on.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CREATE AND FIND APPOINTMENTS QUICKLY</h3>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are like a remote control for quick calendar actions. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Press C to create a new event quickly.
    </li>
    <li>Press / to open up a quick search.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>PRINT YOUR CALENDAR TO CARRY </h3>
<p>Press Command-P (Mac) or Control-P (PC/Chromebook) to open a print menu. Then select among the following options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adjust the date range to print just a dayâ€™s agenda, or a full week to have handy on a trip. </li>
    <li>Choose a bigger font for easier reading or a small font if you have long event titles.</li>
    <li>Choose outline (rather than full color) to save printer ink. </li>

</ul>
