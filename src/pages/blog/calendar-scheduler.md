<h2>Step One</h2>
Start a meeting in an Outlook calendar by double clicking on the day. Schedule the meeting as normal. In the invitees field add the people you need to attend. The lower right will show availability, but this is only effective if you have 5 invitees or less. To easily invite 6 or more staff read on!

<h2>Step Two</h2>
With your event open, click on Scheduling Assistant (top of screen). You'll be taken to a new screen where you can see everyone's schedule per day. Move the current meeting time by dragging to a time where everyone is able to attend. Red means someone is unavailable. Green means everyone is available.

<h2>Step Three</h2>
Add new attendees on the left as needed. When you've landed on a desired date/time click Done and then Send. The meeting will be created and your invitees will be notified.

<h2>DID YOU KNOW?</h2>
You can set an event to Private. This allows you to block time on your calendar without revealing details even if you've shared your calendar details with another person. This is ideal for things like doctors appointments etc. Right click on the item, scroll down to Show as, and click Private.
