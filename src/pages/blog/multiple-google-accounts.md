## Sign in to multiple accounts at once

If you have more than one Google Account, you can sign in to multiple accounts at once. That way, you can switch between accounts without signing out and back in again.

## Add accounts
<ol>
    <li>On your computer, sign in to Google.</li>
    <li>On the top right, select your profile image or initial.</li>
    <li>On the menu, choose Add account.</li>
    <li>Follow the instructions to sign in to the account you want to use.</li>
</ol>

## Switch between accounts
<ol>
    <li>On your computer, sign in to Google</li>
    <li>On the top right, select your profile image or initial.</li>
    <li>On the menu, select the account you'd like to use.</li>
</ol>

## Sign out

<span class='ital'>Important:</span> Before you sign out, make sure you have backup verification methods set up in case you have trouble signing back in.

<ol>
    <li>On your device, go to a Google page, like www.google.com.</li>
    <li>On the top right, select your profile image or initial.</li>
    <li>On the menu, choose Sign out or Sign out of all accounts.</li>

</ol>

## Remove your account from the sign-in page

<ol>
<li>On your device, go to a browser where you're signed in, like Chrome./li>
<li>Go to myaccount.google.com</li>
<li>In the top right, select your profile picture or initial.</li>
<li>Select <span class='ital'>Sign out</span> or <span class='ital'>Sign out of all accounts</span>.</li>
<li>Select <span class='ital'>Remove an account</span>.</li>
<li>Next to an account, select Remove Remove'X'.</li>
<li><span class='ital'>Optional: </span>If you've signed in on other browsers, like Firefox or Safari, repeat these steps for each.</li>
</ol>

## Accounts have separate settings

You can control your settings separately for each of your accounts. When you sign in to multiple accounts, account settings usually aren't shared between accounts. For example, your accounts might have different language settings or sign-in steps.

## Sometimes settings might carry over

If you're signed in to multiple accounts at the same time, sometimes Google can't tell which account you're using. For example, if you're signed in to two accounts and you open a new browser window, we aren't sure which account you want to use. In cases like these, Google might apply settings from your <span class='ital'> default account</span>.

## What a default account is

In many cases, your default account is the one you signed in with first. On mobile devices, your default account can vary depending on your device's operating system and the apps you use.
