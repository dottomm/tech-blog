<h2>Mac keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<p class='ital'>By pressing certain key combinations, you can do things that normally need a mouse, trackpad, or other input device.</p>
<p>The eniter collection of Mac Keyboard Shortcuts are available at <a href='https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236' target="_blank">Apple Support Website</a></p>


<h2>Cycle through all the open windows on your desktop</h2>
<p>The keyboard shortcut <span class='ital'>Command-Tab</span> allows you to quickly step through every app window open on your desktop. As long as the window is open on your desktop and not minimized in your dock, holding down the Command-Tab combination will bring up a window with all your open apps. Continue holding down Command as you tap the Tab key to cycle through the apps and let go when the app you want brought to the front is highlighted.</p>

<h2>Hide the window that's currently open on your desktop</h2>
<p>Instead of minimizing your window with the yellow minus button up in the top left corner, you can quickly hide any window that's open on your desktop with the <span class='ital'>Command-H shortcut</span>. Unlike minimizing, the hide keyboard shortcut hides the window from both your desktop and dock, without closing it completely. To open the window back up, simply click the app icon in either your dock or elsewhere. And if you want to hide all app windows except for the one in front, you can use Option-Command-H.</p>

<h2>Bring up Spotlight to search for files and apps on your computer</h2>
<p>Spotlight search is one of the Mac's most powerful features. Bring up the search bar and type whatever you want to search for, such as text messages, emails, documents, applications, notes, music, settings, movies or locations, this keyboard shortcut is at your fingertips:<span class='ital'> Command-spacebar</span>. </p>

<h2>Highlight the URL in your web browser to quickly share it</h2>
<p>Usually, if you're sharing a web address you double-click in the search bar and then copy the selected text to your clipboard. However, there's a faster way to do this: use <span class='ital'>Command-L</span>. This will immediately highlight whatever is in the address bar in Safari, Chrome or another web browser, whether it's something you typed or the URL of the website you're on. You can then hit Command-C to copy it so you can paste it elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Reopen any closed tabs in the Safari web browser</h2>
<p>You may be familiar with <span class='ital'>Command-T</span> in Safari, which opens a new tab, but there's also a shortcut that can reopen an accidentally closed tab. Simply hit <span class='ital'>Command-Shift-T</span> and you'll recover whatever tab you most recently closed. And if you've closed several tabs and want to recover all of them, you can continue pressing the <span class='ital'>Command-Shift-T</span> shortcut to open multiple closed tabs.</p>
