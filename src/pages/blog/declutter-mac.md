With Spring in the air and plans for cleaning our project documents, I thought it would be timely to discuss cleaning your computer to increase speed and efficiancy. 

In macOS there are tools to help you declutter your Mac. Before you install or buy extra utilities, there are these decluttering features on your Mac.

Go to the Apple menu and choose <span class='ital'>About This Mac</span>. Click on the About This Mac tab. This will show you a list of connected storage, whether SSD or hard drives.

Clicking on the '<span class='ital'>Manage</span>' button will present you a panel with built in tools that can help you manage how to optimize your storage.

The left-side is a navigation through the tools available to you. The default display is the <span class='ital'>recommendations panel</span>.

Each left navigation item is a opportunity to see where your memory is being used. 

## Applications

The Applications tab lists all the applications installed on your computer alphabetically. It can be sorted by name, kind, date latst used, and the size. Using the size column we can see which applications are taking up the most space. 
Selecting one of these files triggers a button to delete the application.

## Documents

The Documents tab default view is of the largest document files on your computer. Additional tabs include:
   
    - Downloads
    - Unsupported Apps
    - Containers
    - File Browser

Each of these tabs can be sorted the same way as the applications. This is a great way to monitor where your computer storage is being consumed. Like the Applications tab; selecting one of these files triggers a button to delete the document.

In addition to the Applications, and Documents. You can see how much space your <span class='ital'>mail</span>,  <span class='ital'>music</span>, or <span class='ital'>video</span> and <span class='ital'>messages</span> is taking up.
