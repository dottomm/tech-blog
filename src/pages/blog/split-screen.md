<h2>How to enter Split View on a Mac</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure neither window you want to use is in full-screen mode.</li>
<li> In one of the windows you want to use, place your cursor over the green button in the top left. Instead of clicking to maximize the window, hover until you see a drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Select Tile Window to Left of Screen or Tile Window to Right of Screen. Your Mac will automatically enter split-screen mode.</li>
<li>From there, other open windows will be displayed on the opposite side of the screen. Click the window you want on the rest of your screen, and it will fill the remaining half.</li>
<li>If you want to adjust the size of the windows, use the slider in the center of the screen.</li>
<p>In Split View, you'll be able to look at both windows simultaneously. Multitask away!</p>
</ol>

<h2>How to split screen on Windows using keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<p>Windows also gives you another great method to split your screen, using keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts work on Windows 10 and Windows 11:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Windows key + right arrow = moves the window to the right</li>
    <li>Windows key + left arrow = moves the window to the left</li>
    <li>Windows key + up arrow = moves the window up</li>
    <li>Windows key + down arrow = moves the window down</li>
</ul>

<p>if you use the right or left arrow command, the window will move right and your screen will be split in two. If you use the up or down arrow command it will become a window split into quarters.</p>

<p>You can then open another window or click on an already open window to snap it into place next to the window you just positioned. Continue to do this until you have your screen looking as you want it to. </p>
