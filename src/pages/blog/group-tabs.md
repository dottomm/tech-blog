<h2>Why Group Tabs Together</h2>
<p>Grouping tabs together is useful if you have multiple tabs open & it becomes difficult to find a tab or to keep related tabs together. Group together by topic, project, meeting, event or web service such as Office 365.</p>

<h2>Step 1: How to Create a New Group Tab</h2>
<p>Right click on one of the tabs you want to group. Click on "Add tab to new group". Type in the name for the group and pick a color. Then hit enter.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Add Tabs to Your Group</h2>
<p>There are two easy ways to add more tabs to this group. First method, right click on the new tab, scroll down to "Add tab to group", click on the name of the group you want to add it to. Second method, click on tab and drag it over to group. This is also an easy way to remove a tab from a group.</p>
