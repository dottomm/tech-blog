<h2>Calls</h2>

<h3>Redial with one tap</h3>
<p>To redial the last number you called on an iPhone, simply open your keypad in the Phone app and tap the green phone icon. One example of how this can come in handy: say you called in a pizza delivery for dinner and forgot to order the mixed salad you also wanted. Just touch the phone icon and you’ll be reconnected, stat.</p>

<h3>Block spam calls</h3>
<p>Tired of receiving robocalls? Good news—we know a tech tip that will help you block spam calls for good.</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class='ital'>iPhone: </span> Go to Settings > Phone > Silence Unknown Callers, and toggle the switch to the “on” position.</li>
    <li><span class='ital'>Android: </span> Go to Call Settings > Caller ID and Spam Protection, and toggle the switch to the “on” position.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hide Caller ID</h3>
<p>Knowing how to block your phone number when calling someone can be a useful tool when you don’t want the recipient to reject your call or you want to avoid revealing your real phone number.</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class='ital'>iPhone: </span> Go to Settings > Phone > Calls > Show My Caller ID, then toggle the switch to the “off” position.
    </li>
    <li><span class='ital'>Android: </span> Open the Phone app and tap on the three-bar menu icon in the upper corner (next to the search bar). Then select Settings > Calls > Additional Settings > Caller ID, and choose “Hide Number.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Record a call</h3>
<p>When you’re having an important phone conversation, recording the call can help you remember all the details. (Just be sure to let the person on the other end of the line know you’re recording them, as it’s illegal in some states to record someone without their knowledge.)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class='ital'>iPhone: </span> Recording a call on iPhones is a little tricky because iPhones don’t have a built-in feature. Here’s a tech tip: You can download a third-party app like <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otter-transcribe-voice-notes/id1276437113' target="_blank">Otter</a> or <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tapeacall-call-recorder/id573751328' target="_blank">TapeACall</a> to record a phone conversation. Or get creative and place the call on speakerphone and use another device (like your desktop or old iPhone) to record the call via the <a href='https://www.rd.com/list/voice-memo-app/' target="_blank">Voice Memos app</a>.</li>
        <li><span class='ital'>Android:</span> Androids have a built-in feature to record phone conversations; all you have to do is tap the “Record” button while you are on a call.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Texts</h2>
<h3>Unsend and edit a message</h3>
<p>Let’s be honest: We’ve all sent a message with an embarrassing typo or fired off a text to the wrong person. Oops!</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class='ital'>iPhone:</span> With the latest version of iOS, you now have the power to undo and edit recently sent iMessages. Simply tap and hold the message you want to edit or remove, then select “Undo Send” if you want to delete it, or tap “Edit” and enter your changes. You’ll need to do it quickly, though—you only have two minutes to unsend or edit an iMessage.</li>
    <li><span class='ital'>Android:</span> While Androids don’t offer this feature yet, you can still avoid embarrassing scenarios in the future by knowing how to <a href='https://www.rd.com/article/how-to-turn-off-autocorrect-on-your-iphone/' target="_blank">turn off autocorrect</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Retrieve deleted text messages</h3>
<p>Drat! One of the texts you deleted is actually a message you need to keep.
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class='ital'>iPhone:</span> If you frequently back up your device to iCloud, you can restore deleted messages by resetting your iPhone. Just tap Settings > General > Reset, then go to the Apps & Data screen and select the “Restore from iCloud Backup” option.
        </li>
        <li><span class='ital'>Android:</span> You can retrieve deleted texts on an Android if you factory reset your Android and restore it using a recent backup.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Battery Life</h2>

<p>A phone that constantly runs out of juice at the wrong time, is a major inconvenience. Luckily, you can top it up ASAP with a few simple hacks. To charge your iPhone or Android fast, try turning on airplane mode or putting your device in low-power mode while it charges.</p>

<h3>Make your battery last longer</h3>
